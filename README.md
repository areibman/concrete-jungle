Concrete Jungle is a non-profit founded by Aubrey Daniels that identifies neglected fruit trees across Atlanta, GA and donates the harvests to the needy. This application, codename "Timber", utilized IBM's AI visual recognition to automatically identify fruit trees from Google Street maps in order to identify new potential sources to harvest.
